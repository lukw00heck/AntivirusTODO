# AntivirusTODO
Something personal


# What I have Done:

## Hashing Check - just a simple SHA256 check of the file....

## YARA applies rules to memory and Files


## NDIS Driver - Detect Network etc...

## File MinFilter - Detect File System Changes

## Process/Thread/Image Notification Driver + Registery + SelfProtection - 

Registery Protect our own keys, SelfProtection Protect our driver and service


## Emulation - using Unicorn 

## Install Driver

## Dump Process Memory from PID

## Stores info in ETW, so info on IOC :)

## Verification of Signature of Files

## Start of a Small javascript praser

## Added small ML algorithim created from a dataset of malware and goodware.

## UnPacking of the Following Packers:

kkrunchy

UPX

## Beginning of a small malware scoring system:

Imports

Exports

Detection of inline hooks 

Detection of Remote Thread Creation 

Add to Startup

Common Registery Keys Used by malware




# What To Do:

apply yara rules inside emulation ?


Add I/O support for drivers so : usermode gui > service > kernel mode


add more to the scoring system

avoid scanning/unpacking  of files with https://github.com/IEEEICSG/IEEE_Taggant_System
